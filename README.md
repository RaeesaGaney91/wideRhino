# wideRhino <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="150" alt="" />

The goal of `wideRhino` is to enable the construction of canonical
variate analysis (CVA) biplots for high-dimensional data settings,
specifically where the number of variables ($p$) exceeds the number of
observations ($n$). The package addresses the singularity limitation of
the within-group scatter matrix by leveraging the generalised singular
value decomposition (GSVD).

## Installation

You can install the development version of wideRhino from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("RaeesaGaney91/wideRhino")
```

## Example

When $p < n$, then the CVA-GSVD biplot will result to the standard CVA
biplot. Here is an example using the `penguins` data:

``` r
library(wideRhino)
Penguins <- datasets::penguins[stats::complete.cases(penguins),]
CVAgsvd(X=Penguins[,3:6],group = Penguins[,1]) |> 
  CVAbiplot(group.col=c("blue","purple","forestgreen"))
```

When $p > n$, then the standard CVA biplot will not work due to the
singularity of the within-scatter matrix, and this is when the GSVD
becomes useful. Using a simulated data set with 3 groups, 100
observations and 300 variables, a CVA-GSVD biplot can be constructed:

``` r
data(sim_data)
CVAgsvd(X=sim_data[,2:301],group = sim_data[,1]) |>
  CVAbiplot(group.col=c("tan1","darkcyan","darkslateblue"),which.var = 1:10,zoom.out=80)
```

## About the name ü¶è

The name `wideRhino` is inspired by the white rhinoceros, a species
distinguished by its wide mouth and short legs. This physical structure
reflects the statistical characteristics of the data the package is
designed for: wide data with a large number of variables ($p$) and a
small number of observations ($n$) - a setting often described as ‚Äúlarge
$p$, small $n$‚Äù.

Just as the white rhino‚Äôs wide frame is well-adapted to its environment,
wideRhino is purpose-built for the challenges of high-dimensional
multivariate analysis. By leveraging the generalised singular value
decomposition (GSVD), it allows users to construct canonical variate
analysis (CVA) biplots even when classical assumptions break down.
